# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Projects

I constructed a dog-breed classifier<br/>
with a ResNet-like CNN from scratch to predict dog breeds.

Then, I implemented a CycleGAN<br/>
to translate winter images into summer ones and vice versa.

I also built a UNet-like DCGAN to generate celebrity faces.

Lastly, I created and deployed a sentiment analysis model with AWS<br/>
to predict the sentiments of movie reviews entered by users.
